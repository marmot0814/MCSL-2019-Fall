\section{The Goal of The Lab}
\paragraph{}
As the specification, implement Hamming Distance, Fibonacci Sequence, Bubble Sort program in ARM Assembly Language(using GNU \texttt{as} and \texttt{unified} instruction set syntax.)
\section{Experiment Procedure}
\subsection{Development Environment}
\paragraph{}
Since Lab1 is relatively simpler, we decide not to use IDE and write the startup code from scratch(linker script is modified from template).
We compile the code with \texttt{arm-none-eabi-*} toolchain and use OpenOCD and gdb to evaluate.
To set up such environment, we created a configuration to inform OpenOCD to communicate with Nucleo board using ST-link debugger and to program STM32L4 microcontroller.
The file(\texttt{openocd.cfg}) is given as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
source [find /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg]
source [find /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32l4x.cfg]
reset_config srst_only srst_nogate

init
reset
\end{lstlisting}
\paragraph{}
With the board connected, we start OpenOCD as a gdb server by issueing \texttt{openocd -f openocd.cfg}, then start the gdb connection:
\begin{lstlisting}
> arm-none-eabi-gdb
(gdb) file main.elf
Reading symbols from /home/austin/Documents/labs/stm32/MCSL-2019/lab1/hamming_dist/main.elf...done.

(gdb) load

Start address 0x800018a, load size 588
Transfer rate: 2 KB/sec, 196 bytes/write.
(gdb)
\end{lstlisting}
After this we are able to set breakpoint and continue the execution of the program.
\subsection{Hamming Distance}
\paragraph{}
The Hamming distance between two integers is the Hamming weight(the number of set bits)
of the exclusive-or(the \texttt{eor} instruction) of the two numbers.
Since processors below Cortex-A8 series doesn't support NEON instruction set, which includes \texttt{vcnt} instruct, we use the implementation
that takes 4 rounds to calculate the result for a 16-bit integer. At each round we groups the bits into odd part and even part,
where the length of the part is 1 initially and doubled at each round.
Then by shifting the number by the length of the part, the odd part and even part in the original number are aligned. 
After adding these two numbers, we will have the sum of the numbers of set bits in the odd part and the even part.
Repeating this procedure will produce the final result.
\paragraph{}
This can be done by a for-loop like structure. However such pattern is also usually unrolled by compiler optimization,
so we left it expanded.
\paragraph{}
For the \texttt{movs} issue, this is caused by the size limit of the \textit{Flexible second operand}
(In the Cortex-M4 manual) in the instruction.
We simply replace it by \texttt{movw} instruction since all the operations are unsigned.
