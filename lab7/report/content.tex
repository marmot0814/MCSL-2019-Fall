\subsection{Clearing the Pending Bits}
\paragraph{}
The pending bit in EXTI pending registers seem to stay high after the handler returns, and should be cleared manually.
We are still not sure about if it is the actual behavior, and also don't know the reason for such design.
\subsection{Other Approaches to Obtain The Pressed Key}
\paragraph{}
In lab 7-2, we were looking for possible ways to obtain what key is pressed when the interrupts are triggered, which includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rescan the whole keypad in the EXTI handlers.
\item Read IDR in the EXTI handlers.
\item Use EXTI line 0 to 4, which have their own seperated handlers in the vector table. This is the approach we used.
\item Read the active bit or pending bit in the handler.
\end{itemize}
Although the third method is easier to implement,
we thought the last may be most appropriate among these methods,
since the bits really indicates the actual state of the exceptions, 
instead of the signal source, which may not keep generating the signal that are still easy to detect.
It is better than the third option since the slots for exception in vector table seems to be fairly expensive,
also the responding procedures are almost the same in each handler.
